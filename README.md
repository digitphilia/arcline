# ✨ Supply Chain Network Optimization

</div>

<div align = "justify">

The **`arcline`** is a Python framework for building, solving, and analyzing supply chain optimization problems as network flow
models. Real supply chains are graphs. Suppliers, plants, warehouses, distribution centers, and customers are nodes; the lanes
between them are arcs (or edges); and the optimization questions that matter - where to source, how much to produce, which
routes to use, when to open or close a facility - are all decisions about flow on those arcs. The project gives you a declarative
API for modeling these networks, a solver-agnostic backend (CBC, HiGHS, Gurobi, CPLEX), and first-class tooling for the parts
of the workflow that real practitioners spend most of their time on: data ingestion, scenario comparison, sensitivity analysis,
and visualization. It is designed to bridge the gap between the academic clarity of textbook formulations and the messy practical
needs of production supply chain teams. Whether you are running a one-off facility location study, building a digital twin of
a global distribution network, or embedding a recurring optimization into a daily planning pipeline, `arcline` aims to be the
layer that makes the network the first-class object - and the math, the I/O, and the solver plumbing fade into the background.
