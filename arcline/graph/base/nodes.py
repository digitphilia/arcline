Abstract Base Class & Explicit Nodes for a Supply Chain Problem
---------------------------------------------------------------

A node (or "vertex") is the fundamental component in graph theory. In
supply chain optimization problems, a node is a variable which is
subjected to change based on different cost functions that is derived
from the interconnected edges of the graph.

The module defines the abstract base node improved with data validation
using :mod:`pydantic` with other default configurations.

    frozen values and can only be defined during initialization.

        is typically allowed in :mod:`networkx` and :mod:`igraph` to

    The optional ``latitude`` and ``longitude`` fields allow callers
    to attach geographic coordinates to a node; when populated, the
    optional geographic coordinates support an optional geographic
    visualization mode (e.g. Mapbox / OpenStreetMap tiles in the
    dashboard) while leaving the abstract layout modes unaffected
    when coordinates are absent.
