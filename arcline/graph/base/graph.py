Abstract Supply Chain Base Graph/Network Definition
---------------------------------------------------

A supply chain problem can typically be defined as a network of nodes
and edges - where each node (or "vertex") can be considered as a
variable subjected to a change and the edges defines the relationship
that can be modeled to define a cost function.

class AbstractGraph(ABC):
    """
    Abstract definition of the generic graph backend which is used as
    an API to interface with different modules (:mod:`networkx` or
    :mod:`igraph`) for a full-network compute or slice the graph on
    defined groups for index level optimization.

    :type  G: Union[MultiDiGraph, Graph, ...]
    :param G: An of graph objects from any compatible modules like
        :class:`networkx.Graph`, or :class:`networkx.MultiDiGraph`, or
        :class:`igraph.Graph` etc. The abstract class is designed to
        work with any concrete module implementation without creating
        any hard dependency for additional available backends.

    :type  name: str
    :param name: Name of the model, this can be any valid string value,
        useful for any type of logging or auditing purposes. Defaults
        to none, which sets the attribute as the name of class.

    :NOTE: A supply chain graph are almost always directional
    (asymmetric lead time and cost from origin to destination) thus
    the graph should always be of type :class:`networkx.DiGraph` or
    should be defined like :class:`igraph.Graph(directed - True)` and
    passed for initialization. In rare cases, when both the direction
    is possible then both ``A → B`` and ``B → A`` edges must be defined.

    :NOTE: The graph will always allow multiple-parallel edges between
    the same pair of endpoints. This ensures that distinct lanes must
    be modeled independently; e.g., different carriers, or contractors,
    or transportation modes. This also ensures that edges are to be
    defined in a manner that the distinct lanes between the source and
    the destination from the multi-graph can be sliced properly based
    on the group definitions, criteria, etc. which should be the
    property of the edge attribute - in concrete implementation. The
    native :class:`networkx.MultiDiGraph` is available, but the default
    alternate is not available directly in the :mod:`igraph` module -
    where the end user needs to define and handle the edge IDs and the
    attributes seperately which is available in the base.

    **Backend Graph Object: Advanced Usage**

    The underlying backend graph object :class:`networkx.MultiDiGraph`
    or the :class:`igraph.Graph` is available as ``G`` attribute to
    the class. This is useful for advanced users who wants to work with
    backend-specific routines that the abstract surface does not
    automatically expose (custom :mod:`igraph` community detection, or
    :mod:`networkx` internal algorithms, etc.) directly.

    **Backend Agnostic Base Methods**

    Some basic functions/graph attributes are directly available as
